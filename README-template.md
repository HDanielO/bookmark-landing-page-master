### What I learned

It's been a while(I had issues with my laptop for most of last year), but I am finally back. Building this project took a while, mostly because of exams but I'm glad I finished it.

Now what I learnt;

It was really fun to dirty my hands with styling after a long time and this is my first mobile-first webflow(thank you Ade for pushing me lol). It was actually easier than what I had in my head, would definitly continue with it in upcoming projects.

Another thing I am happy I got to improve on was the navbar functionality. I've only done like 1 or 3 projects with navbar functionality. I am also happy I got to improve on my responsiveness(sigh it's really kinda weird I am still doing projects like this in 2025)

I learnt about and implemented email regex in my email validation functionality. That was my most fun part(the most difficult is still styling, sigh.)

I also got to learn about accordion functionality and was able to implement the idea in some other segments of the code.

Anyway, that's all for now. I'll be building more frontend mentor in the following weeks, hopefully I learn more and get better.

### Continued development

For areas I would definitely focus on in future;

- Mobile-first Webflow
- React JS(I recently just learnt the fundamentals should build something with it soon)
- Tailwind CSS(although I prefer using normal css but everyone is saying that tailwind will make my work faster so I might just build somethings with it)
